# Commit Message Standards

When creating commit messages, ALWAYS follow the Conventional Commits specification as defined in `doc/COMMIT_STANDARDS.md`.

## Required Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

## Rules

1. **Type**: Must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
2. **Scope**: Optional, but recommended (e.g., components, layout, api, config, docs, workflows, types, styles)
3. **Subject**: 
   - Imperative, present tense
   - Lowercase first letter
   - No period at end
   - Max 72 characters
4. **Body**: 
   - Explain "what" and "why", not "how"
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes
   - Wrap at 72 characters

## Examples

✅ Good:
```
feat(dashboard): add project cards with hover effects

Implement interactive project cards with terminal-style glow effects.
Cards use bg-card/80 with border-primary/20 for better visibility.
```

❌ Bad:
```
Updated files
Added new feature
fix:bug
```

## When Creating Commits

- Always use the format above
- Reference the full standards in `doc/COMMIT_STANDARDS.md` for complex commits
- For multi-file changes, group related changes in the body with bullet points
