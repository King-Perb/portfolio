# Commit Message Standards

When creating commit messages, ALWAYS follow the Conventional Commits specification as defined below.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm, bundler)
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the area of the codebase affected:
- `components`: UI components
- `layout`: Layout components
- `api`: API routes
- `config`: Configuration files
- `docs`: Documentation
- `workflows`: GitHub Actions workflows
- `types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `styles`: CSS/styling changes

## Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Maximum 72 characters

## Body (Optional)

- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. the "how"
- Can include multiple paragraphs
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Examples

### Good Examples

```
feat(dashboard): add project cards with hover effects

Implement interactive project cards with terminal-style glow effects
on hover. Cards now use bg-card/80 with border-primary/20 for better
visibility against dark background.

- Add hover shadow effects
- Update card styling to match design system
- Implement group hover states
```

```
ci: add GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with:
- Lint, type-check, and build verification
- Gitleaks security scanning
- Branch protection setup workflow
```

```
docs: move implementation plan to doc/ folder

Reorganize documentation structure by moving implementation_plan.md
to doc/ folder for better organization. Update all references.
```

### Bad Examples

```
❌ Updated files
❌ Fixed stuff
❌ WIP
❌ feat: Added new feature
❌ fix:bug in component
```

## Multi-line Commit Messages

For complex changes, use a detailed body:

```
feat(components): implement dashboard metrics and project grid

Add comprehensive dashboard components with proper TypeScript types
and mock data structure.

Components:
- OverviewMetrics: Display activity statistics
- ProjectsGrid: Showcase featured projects with interactive cards

Infrastructure:
- Extract mock data to src/data/mock-data.ts
- Create TypeScript interfaces in src/types/
- Update components to use extracted data

This establishes the foundation for Phase 2 GitHub API integration.
```

## Breaking Changes

Always document breaking changes:

```
feat(api): refactor GitHub stats endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: GitHub stats API now returns data in a different format.
The response structure has changed from flat object to nested structure.

Migration:
- Update frontend components to use new response format
- See MIGRATION.md for detailed changes
```

## When Creating Commits

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating a commit message, you MUST:

1. **Analyze ALL changed files**: Run `git status` or `git status --short` to see all modified, added, and deleted files
2. **Review staged changes**: Use `git diff --cached` to see what's staged
3. **Review unstaged changes**: Use `git diff` to see unstaged changes
4. **Include all changes**: The commit message must accurately represent ALL changes being committed
5. **Group related changes**: For multi-file changes, group related changes in the body with bullet points

**Never create a commit message without first reviewing all changed files.** The commit message should comprehensively cover all significant changes.

- Always use the format above
- For multi-file changes, group related changes in the body with bullet points

## Commit Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: When the user requests multiple commits:

- **Stop after each commit** - Do NOT proceed to the next commit automatically
- Wait for user confirmation or explicit request before creating the next commit
- This allows the user to review each commit before moving to the next one
